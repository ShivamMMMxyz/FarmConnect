# Order & Payment Flow - User Guide

## New Pages Created

- **Features:**
  - Shipping information form with validation
  - Fields: Name, Email, Phone, Address, City, State, Pincode, Delivery Notes

- **Shows:**
  - All placed orders from localStorage
  - Order ID, date, and status
  - Product images and quantities
  - Payment method

  - Total amount

## User Flow

```
Cart â†’ Checkout â†’ Payment â†’ Order Success â†’ My Orders
```

1. **Add items to cart** â†’ Click "Proceed to Checkout"
2. **Fill shipping information** â†’ Click "Proceed to Payment"
3. **Select payment method** and enter details â†’ Click "Pay" or "Place Order"
4. **Order confirmed** â†’ View order details
5. **Navigate to My Orders** â†’ See all past orders

## Technical Details

### Data Storage (Dummy Mode)
- **Shipping Info:** Stored in `sessionStorage` during checkout
- **Orders:** Stored in `localStorage` as array
- **Cart:** Cleared after successful order

### Order Object Structure
```javascript
{
  orderId: "ORD1234567890",
  orderDate: "2025-11-01T...",
  items: [...cart items],
  shippingInfo: {...address details},
  paymentMethod: "card|upi|cod",
  totalAmount: 1234.56
}
```

### Routes Added
```javascript
/checkout          - Shipping information form
/payment           - Payment method selection
/order-success     - Order confirmation
/my-orders         - Order history
```

## Styling Features
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded status indicators
- Card-based layouts
- Form validation error states
- Loading states during processing

## Next Steps for Backend Integration
To connect with real backend:

1. **Checkout Page:**
   - Replace `sessionStorage` with state management
   - Add API call to validate address
   
2. **Payment Page:**
   - Integrate payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe, etc.)
   - Create order on backend before payment
   - Update order status after payment success
   
3. **Order Success:**
   - Fetch order details from backend API
   - Send confirmation email via backend
   
4. **My Orders:**
   - Replace `localStorage` with API call to fetch orders
   - Add order tracking functionality
   - Enable order cancellation/return

## Testing the Flow

1. Start the frontend dev server
2. Add products to cart
3. Go to cart and click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. Fill in the shipping form (dummy data is fine)
5. Click "Proceed to Payment"
6. Select any payment method:
   - **Card:** Use dummy card `1234 5678 9012 3456`
   - **UPI:** Use any UPI format like `test@upi`
   - **COD:** Just click "Place Order"
7. Wait 2 seconds for processing
8. See order success page
9. Click "View My Orders" to see your order history
