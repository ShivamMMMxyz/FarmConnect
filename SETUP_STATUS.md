## 🎨 Design Approach

- **Farmers**: Green theme (#2e7d32) - representing agriculture
- **Customers**: Blue theme (#1976d2) - representing marketplace
- **Clean, modern UI** with good spacing and readability
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop

## 📋 What I Need from You

1. **Should I proceed to build all the frontend pages?**
2. **Any specific design preferences?** (colors, layout style)
3. **Do you want all features or start with core features?**
   - Core: Auth, Add Products, Browse Products
   - Full: + Cart, Orders, Tool Rentals, etc.

## 🔧 Current Status
